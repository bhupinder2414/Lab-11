# Accordion Component

This is a simple accordion component built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to toggle between sections to view more content, and it's designed with accessibility in mind.

## Features
- Toggle content visibility by clicking or using the keyboard.
- Accessibility features include proper ARIA attributes for screen readers.
- Keyboard-friendly interactions using `Enter` or `Space` keys.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bhupinder2414//Lab-11.git
   
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   
  ```bash
   cd Lab-11
  ```
3. Open index.html in your browser to view the accordion in action.

**Usage**

To add the accordion to your web page:

- Include the index.html file and accordion.css in your project.
- Add the JavaScript code from accordion.js to manage the accordion interactions.
  
Make sure the structure follows the example below:

```bash
<button class="accordion" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="content1" id="accordion1">
Section Title</button>
<div class="accordion-content" id="content1" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion1">
  <p>Content goes here...</p>
</div>
```

**Keyboard Accessibility**

This accordion supports keyboard interactions:

- Tab: Navigate between accordion buttons.

- Enter or Space: Toggle the accordion section open or closed.

The state of each accordion section (open/closed) is announced by screen readers, based on the aria-expanded attribute.

**Accessibility Features**

- ARIA roles and attributes: Each accordion button is assigned the role="button" and aria-expanded attributes. The content of each section is associated with its button via the aria-controls attribute, improving screen reader usability.
- Keyboard navigation: Accordion buttons can be activated using the Enter or Space keys, ensuring that users with motor disabilities can interact with the accordion without needing a mouse.
